	<h1>Time complexity and Space complexity</h1>
	<p>the time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.It is the efficient way of completing any task.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a concept parallel to time complexity in computer science. While time complexity measures how long an algorithm takes to run, <b>space complexity</b> quantifies the amount of memory space an algorithm requires.When an algorithm has an O(n) <b>space complexity,</b> it means that the amount of memory it uses grows linearly with the input size.</p>
